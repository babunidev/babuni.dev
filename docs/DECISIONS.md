# Design and Engineering Decision Register

**Status vocabulary:** Accepted, Proposed, Experimental, Superseded, Open. Entries reconstructed from conversation are marked retrospective. New decisions should include date, creator input, AI proposal, rationale, and evidence.

## D-001 — Projects over chronological blog
**Status:** Accepted · **Source:** retrospective conversation, October 2026  
**Creator direction:** A playful portfolio of works, including WIP, rather than a linear blog.  
**Decision:** Project-focused discovery is the primary navigation; the journal is part of each project's history.  
**Rationale:** Visitors discover creative objects first and read chronology where useful.

## D-002 — Shared content model, flexible modules
**Status:** Accepted  
**Creator direction:** Each project can carry very different kinds of media and descriptions.  
**Decision:** Reusable module types with conditional layout, not one fixed article template.

## D-003 — Stone tile and colored portal
**Status:** Accepted, visual details experimental  
**Creator direction:** Engraved title, central recessed portal, personal stylized stone design, project-dependent carving.  
**AI alternatives explored:** Historical-looking masonry, deeply ornamented fantasy relics, a scenic background.  
**Decision:** Minimal original stone surface and colored portal; no scenic background behind full-screen grid.

## D-004 — Point-origin information bubbles
**Status:** Accepted  
**Creator correction:** Bubbles describe the project; they are not navigational shortcuts.  
**Decision:** Four contextual lights emit bounded holographic snippets with random, point-hover, and linger behaviors.

## D-005 — Layered discovery
**Status:** Accepted  
**Creator direction:** Click to inspect; click selected tile again to commit; click modules for detail.  
**Decision:** Grid → small bloom → full bloom → expanded module.  
**Rejected:** Wheel gestures as the main method of opening because they conflict with reading.

## D-006 — Spatially honest small bloom
**Status:** Accepted  
**Creator correction:** A module claims the space of an adjacent cell; its original tile moves away.  
**Decision:** Small bloom reserves grid cells and displaces physical neighbors rather than stacking freely overlapping panels.

## D-007 — Full bloom is a focused project world
**Status:** Accepted  
**Creator direction:** Other projects should disappear while in full bloom. The originating tile remains the central anchor and exit; content uses simple frames.  
**Decision:** One project at a time, with independently expandable preview modules.

## D-008 — Grid line shifts and initiative
**Status:** Experimental  
**Creator direction:** Slow shifts of whole rows/columns, with random d20 eligibility and initiative bonuses.  
**Decision:** Prototype this system. Final bonus distribution, scheduling and conflicts remain open.

## D-009 — Endless recycling
**Status:** Accepted concept; algorithm open  
**Creator direction:** Dragging should never reveal a grid edge; offstage tiles reappear ahead, repeated projects allowed when necessary.  
**AI proposal:** Toroidal coordinates and a buffer; distinct logical project IDs and visual instance IDs.  
**Decision:** Implement recycling early and test its interaction with row/column shifts and blooms.

## D-010 — Progressive center-out appearance
**Status:** Accepted concept  
**Creator direction:** Show center immediately, materialize outward, preload only nearby buffer and relevant assets.  
**Decision:** Avoid compulsory blocking loading screen; lazy-load heavy content.  
**Open:** Buffer policy and prioritization should be performance-tested.

## D-011 — Astro foundation and interactive island
**Status:** Astro accepted and committed; interactive framework Proposed  
**Creator direction:** Cloud-first development, local testing, future local agents.  
**AI recommendation:** Astro with TypeScript and possibly Svelte for the grid.  
**Decision:** Astro is chosen; Svelte remains a candidate and is not installed or implemented in the reviewed repository.
**Verification update (2026-10-26):** Foundation integrated on `main` in `5902121`; independent starter build passed against `ea90117`. This updates implementation evidence without changing the framework decision.

## D-012 — The site documents itself
**Status:** Accepted concept  
**Creator direction:** The website must exhibit its own development history, possibly as the central initial tile.  
**Decision:** The website is eligible as its own portfolio project. Default tile placement remains experimental.

## D-013 — Human–AI provenance is core documentation
**Status:** Accepted  
**Creator direction:** The creative record must show what the human asked or corrected, and what AI did in response.  
**Decision:** Distinguish creator requests, AI proposals, creator decisions, executed changes, and verification; see docs/AI_COLLABORATION.md.  
**Constraint:** Never fabricate missing conversations or publish sensitive raw transcripts.

## Adding decisions

For each entry add date, status, motivating creator request, alternatives (including AI-originated ones), rationale, impact, and verification links. When changing a decision, mark the original **Superseded** rather than silently rewriting history.

## D-014 — Main-only development workflow
**Status:** Accepted · **Date:** 2026-10-26
**Creator direction:** Development should take place directly on `main`, not through a branch-and-PR routine.
**AI contribution:** Initially prepared a separate documentation branch for safety, then honored the creator's correction and supported integrating local Astro work with repository documentation on `main`.
**Decision:** Make direct `main` updates the default. Remain careful with local uncommitted work and use explicit approval before deployment or destructive operations.
**Verification:** Merge commit `5902121` was pushed by the creator and verified on GitHub. The branch workflow was superseded for future changes.

## D-015 — Start from screen-center; free map-like dragging and recycled DOM cells
**Status:** Accepted interaction; responsive size values initial · **Date:** 2026-10-26
**Creator direction:** The initial layout must have one full tile exactly at screen center, regardless of desktop, tablet or phone size, with a perfectly top-down wall of squares. The grid should respond to holding and dragging with the mouse or swiping with the thumb, as in Google Maps. Tiles leaving an edge should be reused just beyond the opposite edge, keeping the visual field continuous without accumulating unlimited new tiles.
**AI contribution:** Suggested viewport-centered logical coordinates, a 240/200/phone-relative CSS-pixel scale based on approved mockup size, and a fixed DOM tile pool with two offscreen buffer bands. Interpreted recycling as reassigning visual element positions, not destroying project identities or keeping an infinite history of mounted nodes.
**Decision:** One centered initial tile, unbounded free pan, automatic offscreen tile reuse, no row/column fitting constraint. Motion inertia remains an open future option, not an accepted requirement.
**Implementation and verification:** First provisional Astro/TypeScript prototype; five geometry tests and isolated Chromium layout/drag checks passed. Full Astro build and real phone/tablet touch tests are not yet verified.
